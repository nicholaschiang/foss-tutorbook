    <p>
      Any type of information that users provide to the Company to provide the
      services of any of the platforms must comply with the following
      requirements:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>It must not be false or misleading.</li>
      <li>It will not infringe copyright on any third party.</li>
      <li>Will not violate any law, statute, ordinance or regulation.</li>
      <li>Will not be obscene or contain pornography.</li>
      <li>
        It will not contain any computer programming viruses that are intended
        to damage, harmfully interfere, intercept or expropriate any system,
        data or personal information.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ensure that as a user, whether a student or guardian, has not been the
        subject of a complaint, order or any other legal action that implies
        restriction, arrest or conviction for a crime that involves endangering
        the safety of persons.
      </li>
      <li>
        The user will allow the Company to verify their criminal, judicial,
        professional and personal records with the information provided.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      All those evaluations that are carried out both from the tutor towards the
      student and vice versa, which are opinions of the users that do not
      correspond to the opinions of the Company, are alien to our assessment of
      the interaction between the users, so the Company refrains from any
      liability or moral damage that may arise from said comments among users.
      However, when a tutor has negative opinions of the students or vice versa
      the Company may delete this information at any time if it is not suitable
      for the terms of use of the educational platforms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each user grants the right to freely use any type of information and/ or
      material that is collected from both the mobile and web platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each tutor or student recognizes that the Company shall not owe any
      financial or other remuneration for the use of the information or material
      that is collected from the mobile or web platform.

    <div class="terms__policy-heading">8. Code of Ethics</div>
    <p>
      The Company, to preserve the quality of its services and a pleasant
      atmosphere between both users, stipulates the following regulations in the
      use of the Company's services.

      Both types of users (student and tutor) are subject to compliance with the
      following regulations:
    </p>
    <p>
      Act with honesty, respect, kindness and patience with any type of user
      involved in any of the services provided by the Company.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unpunctuality of the tutoring lesson should not be repetitive. In case
      there is a delay by any of the parties, it is obliged to keep in constant
      communication with the other party to let them know, in case of any
      complaint or suggestion it should be made directly to the educational
      institution to which it belongs, since it is understood that the service
      is provided directly by the educational institution. The Company only
      provides the intermediation and data analysis service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Communication with the tutor or student can be done only and exclusively
      through the messaging system incorporated in any of the Company's
      platforms. The exchange of any personal information including cell phone
      numbers, photographs, social networks, etc. is strictly prohibited.

    <p>
      Once users access the platform to request the services of the Company,
      users must necessarily be of legal age, where the user must be over 18
      years of age. If a user, who is a minor, requires a tutoring service, the
      service must be previously authorized by their parents or by the competent
      authorities. Similarly, the Company always requests the presence of a
      person of legal age who is with the student, when he is a minor, who must
      be present at the time of the tutoring lesson. It should be considered
      that the authorization of the minor student to receive the tutoring lesson
      is an acceptance of our terms of use. The educational institutions are
      responsible for letting their users (tutors / students) know about past
      regulations, in case they do not, it will be understood that the
      educational institution is responsible for any damage or harm against any
      of its users.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Company will not be responsible for any false information that is
      recorded or any action carried out with intent or bad faith that leads the
      Company's administrators to mistakenly understand the user's age or
      parental consent or competent authority. All information provided by the
      educational institution is understood to be correct and provided in good
      faith to the Company.

    <p>
      Since the functionality of the Company it’s only to be the intermediary
      between both users and the service is provided directly to the educational
      institution it is necessary to point out that, in case of any dispute
      between the users, they release the Company (and our subsidiary companies,
      employees or any person) of any claim, claims or damages (real or
      resulting) of any kind and nature, arising out of or related in any way to

      The educational institution may not develop any type of mobile and / or

      tutors and students instantly, for within a period of 5 years and will
      start counting as soon as the service to the educational institution is
      stopped. The spirit of this, is inspired by the following reasoning:
    </p>
    <ul>

        Experience”, in the use of any of the platforms.

        of educational institutions and their students.

        platforms, where one of the main objectives is to improve the
        performance of educational institutions, students and programs based on
        statistics.
      </li>

        of the mobile and web platform as well as its Artificial Intelligence
        tool.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the educational institution does not comply with this, the Company
        will have the right to demand for rights for the damages and losses
        valued in the present time of the moment in which it was breached.

    <p>
      At Tutorbook we take the protection of customer data extremely seriously.
      This Tutorbook Security Policy describes the organizational and technical
      measures Tutorbook implements platform wide designed to prevent
      unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure of customer data. The
      Tutorbook services operate on the Google Cloud Platform (&quot;GCP&quot;)
      via Google's Firebase App Infrastructure (&quot;Firebase&quot;); this
      policy describes activities of Tutorbook within its Firebase project(s)
      unless otherwise specified. As you continue to learn more about Tutorbook
      we recommend you also review our
      <a href="https://www.intercom.com/terms-and-policies#terms"

    <ul>
      <li>
        We have implemented a formal procedure for security events and have
        educated all our staff on our policies.
      </li>
      <li>
        When security events are detected they are escalated to our emergency
        alias, teams are paged, notified and assembled to rapidly address the
        event.
      </li>
      <li>
        After a security event is fixed we write up a post-mortem analysis.
      </li>
      <li>
        The analysis is reviewed in person, distributed across the company and
        includes action items that will make the detection and prevention of a
        similar event easier in the future.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tutorbook will promptly notify you in writing upon verification of a
        security breach of the Tutorbook services that affects your data.
        Notification will describe the breach and the status of Tutorbook’s
        investigation.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="terms__policy-subheading">Build Process Automation</div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        We have functioning, frequently used automation in place so that we can
        safely and reliably rollout changes to both our application and
        operating platform within minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        We typically deploy code dozens of times a day, so we have high
        confidence that we can get a security fix out quickly when required.

  <div id="security_infrastructure">
    <div class="sp__2"></div>
    <div class="terms__policy-heading">Infrastructure</div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        All of our services run in the cloud. Tutorbook does not run our own
        routers, load balancers, DNS servers, or physical servers.
      </li>
      <li>
        All of our services and data are hosted in Firebase-supported GCP
        facilities in the USA and protected by Google security, as described at
        <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy"
          >https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy</a
        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        All of our infrastructure is spread across 3 regional GCP resource
        locations (one multi-region location) and will continue to work should
        any one of those locations fail unexpectedly. Data is stored across
        GCP's <code>nam5</code>
        <a href="https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/locations#location-mr"
          >multi-region location</a
        >
        that consists of the <code>us-central1</code> and
        <code>us-central2</code> regional resource locations with additional
        metadata stored in the Oklahoma private region. See

        Tutorbook uses a backup solution for datastores that contain customer
        data.

    <ul>
      <li>All customer data is stored in the USA.</li>
      <li>
        Customer data is stored in multi-tenant Firestore datastores
        (&quot;Firestores&quot;); we do not have individual datastores for each
        customer. However strict privacy controls exist in our application code
        that are designed to ensure data privacy and to prevent one customer
        from accessing another customer’s data (i.e., logical separation). We
        have many unit and integration tests in place to ensure these privacy
        controls work as expected. These tests are run every time our codebase
        is updated and even one single test failing will prevent new code from
        being shipped to production.
      </li>
      <li>
        Each Tutorbook system used to process customer data is adequately
        configured and pathed using commercially-reasonable methods according to
        industry-recognized system-hardening standards.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tutorbook engages certain subprocessors to process customer data. These
        subprocessors are listed at

        Tutorbook from time to time.

    <ul>
      <li>
        All data sent to or from Tutorbook is encrypted in transit using 256-bit
        encryption.
      </li>
      <li>
        Our application endpoints are TLS/SSL only and score an &quot;A+&quot;
        rating on SSL Labs' tests.
      </li>
      <li>
        We also encrypt data at rest under an industry-standard AES-256
        encryption algorithm, and each encryption key is itself encrypted with a
        regularly rotated set of master keys. For more information, see

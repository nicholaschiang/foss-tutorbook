    <p>
      When you use the Offerings, we make good faith efforts to provide you with
      access to your personal information upon your request and either provide
      you the means to correct this information if it is inaccurate or to delete
      such information at your request if it is not otherwise required to be
      retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. You may access,
      review, correct, update, change or delete your information at any time. To
      do so, please contact us at
      <a href="mailto:team@tutorbook.app">team@tutorbook.app</a> with your name
      and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed, or if
      you are using the Service, sign in to your account, go to your profile,
      and make the desired changes. We may decline to process requests that are
      unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical
      effort (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup
      tapes), jeopardize the privacy of others, would be extremely impractical,
      or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we
      provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of
      charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.

    <p>
      Please note that if you cease using the Service or we terminate your
      access to the Service in accordance with your Customer Agreement, you may
      no longer have the ability to access or update your information.

      We may retain your information as necessary to support the Offerings,
      comply with our legal obligations or resolve disputes. Note that content
      you post may remain on the Offerings even if you cease using the Offerings
      or we terminate your access to the Offerings.

    <p>
      The security of your personal information is important to us. We maintain
      a variety of appropriate technical and organizational safeguards to
      protect your personal information. We limit access to personal information
      about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact
      with that information to provide products or services to you or in order
      to do their jobs. Further, we have implemented reasonable physical,
      electronic, and procedural safeguards designed to protect personal
      information about you. When you enter sensitive information (such as your
      password), we encrypt that information in transit using industry-standard
      Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption technology. No method of
      transmission over the Internet, method of electronic storage or other
      security methods are one hundred percent secure. Therefore, while we
      strive to use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we
      cannot guarantee its absolute security.

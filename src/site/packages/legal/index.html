              We have implemented a formal procedure for security events and

            </li>
            <li>
              When security events are detected they are escalated to our
              emergency alias, teams are paged, notified and assembled to
              rapidly address the event.
            </li>
            <li>
              After a security event is fixed we write up a post-mortem
              analysis.
            </li>
            <li>
              The analysis is reviewed in person, distributed across the company
              and includes action items that will make the detection and
              prevention of a similar event easier in the future.

              Tutorbook will promptly notify you in writing upon verification of
              a security breach of the Tutorbook services that affects your
              data. Notification will describe the breach and the status of
              Tutorbook’s investigation.

              Tutorbook uses a backup solution for datastores that contain

              Customer data is stored in multi-tenant Firestore datastores

              each customer. However strict privacy controls exist in our
              application code that are designed to ensure data privacy and to
              prevent one customer from accessing another customer’s data (i.e.,
              logical separation). We have many unit and integration tests in
              place to ensure these privacy controls work as expected. These
              tests are run every time our codebase is updated and even one
              single test failing will prevent new code from being shipped to
              production.

            The Company is a startup which provides services through its
            technological platforms directly to educational institutions and to
            private users whose purpose is to connect students and tutors so
            that academic tutoring lessons are carried out instantly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Expert tutors in their teaching area have the possibility to share
            their knowledge, while students are those who seek to improve their
            academic performance or expand their knowledge and can find the
            ideal tutor quickly, safely and accessibly to learn.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Company being a multi-platform for linking users of 2 types:
            student and tutor, operates solely and exclusively as an
            intermediary between them, without any other responsibility for
            communication between them or any agreement outside the platforms
            they may establish.

            rights and obligations of the parties (the Company and the
            educational institution) will be subject to the specifications
            established in the Services Agreement that is concluded with each
            specific educational institution, in case of doubt consult the

            </li>
            <li>
              Ensure that as a user, whether a student or guardian, has not been
              the subject of a complaint, order or any other legal action that
              implies restriction, arrest or conviction for a crime that
              involves endangering the safety of persons.
            </li>
            <li>
              The user will allow the Company to verify their criminal,

            </li>

            All those evaluations that are carried out both from the tutor

            that do not correspond to the opinions of the Company, are alien to
            our assessment of the interaction between the users, so the Company
            refrains from any liability or moral damage that may arise from said
            comments among users. However, when a tutor has negative opinions of
            the students or vice versa the Company may delete this information
            at any time if it is not suitable for the terms of use of the
            educational platforms.

            platform.

          </p>
          <p>
            Both types of users (student and tutor) are subject to compliance
            with the following regulations:
          </p>
          <p>
            Act with honesty, respect, kindness and patience with any type of
            user involved in any of the services provided by the Company.

            The unpunctuality of the tutoring lesson should not be repetitive.
            In case there is a delay by any of the parties, it is obliged to
            keep in constant communication with the other party to let them
            know, in case of any complaint or suggestion it should be made
            directly to the educational institution to which it belongs, since
            it is understood that the service is provided directly by the
            educational institution. The Company only provides the
            intermediation and data analysis service.
          </p>
          <p>
            Communication with the tutor or student can be done only and
            exclusively through the messaging system incorporated in any of the
            Company's platforms. The exchange of any personal information
            including cell phone numbers, photographs, social networks, etc. is
            strictly prohibited.

            Once users access the platform to request the services of the
            Company, users must necessarily be of legal age, where the user must
            be over 18 years of age. If a user, who is a minor, requires a
            tutoring service, the service must be previously authorized by their
            parents or by the competent authorities. Similarly, the Company
            always requests the presence of a person of legal age who is with
            the student, when he is a minor, who must be present at the time of
            the tutoring lesson. It should be considered that the authorization
            of the minor student to receive the tutoring lesson is an acceptance
            of our terms of use. The educational institutions are responsible
            for letting their users (tutors / students) know about past
            regulations, in case they do not, it will be understood that the
            educational institution is responsible for any damage or harm
            against any of its users.

            The Company will not be responsible for any false information that
            is recorded or any action carried out with intent or bad faith that
            leads the Company's administrators to mistakenly understand the
            user's age or parental consent or competent authority. All
            information provided by the educational institution is understood to
            be correct and provided in good faith to the Company.

            The educational institution may not develop any type of mobile and /
            or web platform like that of the Company, whose main objective is to
            connect tutors and students instantly, for within a period of 5
            years and will start counting as soon as the service to the
            educational institution is stopped. The spirit of this, is inspired
            by the following reasoning:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The Company has dedicated more than 3 years of research in UX
              “User Experience”, in the use of any of the platforms.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Company has invested economic resources in terms of customer
              satisfaction and how to use the platforms.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Company has carried out studies and made tests regarding the
              needs of educational institutions and their students.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Company has invested economic resources in the creation of the
              platforms, where one of the main objectives is to improve the
              performance of educational institutions, students and programs
              based on statistics.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Company has invested economic resources in the development of
              software programs on which the mobile and web platform are based.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Company has invested economic resources in the administrative
              system of the mobile and web platform as well as its Artificial
              Intelligence tool.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the educational institution does not comply with this, the
              Company will have the right to demand for rights for the damages
              and losses valued in the present time of the moment in which it
              was breached.
